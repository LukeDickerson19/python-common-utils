    make the python logging_utils thread safe like the c log_utils are

BACKLOG:

    enable logging util to overwrite prev line in logfile too (not just console)

        the print_same_line function does not print to the same line
        in the actual log file. It should convert the contents of the
        log equal to length of blanked_out_previous_string to blank
        space character, then replace them with the new text

        also, why doesn't the print_same_line function print to the same
        line in the console when on windows, but it works on linux?

    fix up general utils
        required for aws_utils to work

    fix up aws utils

    fix up snowflake utils

    clean up the notes above each function
        or maybe make a docs page in markdown

    maybe make the logging utils a python lib
