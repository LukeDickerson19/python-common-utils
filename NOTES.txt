DESCRIPTION

	Utility functions for common backend processes:
		logging utils
		aws utils
		snowflake utils
		mysql utils
		oracle utils
		emails utils
		general utils

	Visit each util subfolder in the common_utils folder for details on the functions each util provides.


TO DO

	restructure each *_util.py file in the src folder to be like the util folders in the common_utils folder

		what i've fixed up so far is
			common_utils/logging_utils
			common_utils/email_utils/outlook_utils

		for each one you need to see what constants it uses in src/constants.py
			and replicate the exact structure of the:
				<util_folders>/<util>/src/libraries_and_constants.py

		give each one its own readme too
			write python script to convert NOTES.txt to README.md markup
				in the markup (nothing fancy) make:
					DESCRIPTION, TO DO, SOURCES, ect. all bold text with big size
					all four space characters converted to tabs
					all tabs converted to tabs in markup
					all other regular text stays the same
					see if text wraps automatically in README.md on github

	fix up general utils
		required for aws_utils to work

	fix up aws utils

	clean up the notes above each function

	make common_components a python lib
